- Will you treat *Google Summer of Code* as full time employment?

    No. I will volunteer during the summer vacation.

- How many hours per week will you work?

    30~40

- List all obligations (and their dates) that may take time away from GSoC (a second job, vacations, classes, ...): 

    |                        |                    |                               |
    | :--------------------: | :----------------: | :---------------------------: |
    | 1st June~1st September |  Summer vacation   |                               |
    | 10th June~25st August  | Voluntary Activity | 4 hours a day except weekends |

    I can spend at least **4 hours a day on GSoC**, and if I have extra time, I wiil put it in.

- Are you using *Google Summer of Code* to fullfill a university requirement -- internship, class credit, ..? (If so, you need to provide confirmation that your school approves. Remember, *Google Summer of Code* is a remote software development internship.)

    No.

- How and when did you first heard about Haiku?

    via GSoC 2018

- Did you also apply to other GSoC organizations? If so, which is your order of preference? (this has no impact on the selection process, we use this information only if you are selected as an intern by several of these organizations to decide which one would keep you)

    No, Haiku is the **only** organization I apply for.

- Estimated last day of classes/exams

    25th May

- Estimated first day of classes (for most interns, there will be some overlap with the GSoC coding period. This is fine, but we want to check that you have planned your timeline accordingly)

    25th May is my last day at school.

#### (Open-ended)

1. Introduce yourself. (Who you are. Why you chose Haiku. What programming experience you have.)

    My [resume](./resume.pdf) is attached.

    In 2018, I tried to apply for haiku, but was rejected due to lack of knowledge. This year is my last year in school, and I hope to draw a perfect end to my college life.

2. Project Proposal. (Title. Description. Goals.)

    [Annex](./ARM_port_and_device_tree_support_proposal.md)

3. Timeline. Include what you plan to have accomplished by the end of:

    |                          |                            |                                                              |
    | :----------------------: | :------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
    | Community Bonding period |      May 20 - June 12      | Read the code, refine the plan, and identify problems early  |

    |                          |          Week 3-6          |           Get and printing out the contents of DTS           |
    |                          |           Week 7           |                 Prepare for First Evaluation                 |
    |     Coding Phase II      |   July 30 - September 4    |                                                              |
    |                          |         Week 8-10          |                       Implement drive                        |
    |                          |         Week 11-13         |                      Debug and fix bugs                      |
    |        Final Week        | September 5 - September 12 |                 Prepare for Final Evaluation                 |
    |        After GSoC        |                            | I am interested in the design and implementation of Haiku. If there is a problem when reading the code, I will create issue or directly modify it. |

4. Expectations from Mentors. (What do you expect Haiku's mentors to help you with?)

    Most of the problems can be solved by reading the code, but knowing more about how the author design concrete code before 

    that will helps me to be efficient.
